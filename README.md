# PROJECT

Node.js/Express.js app that will serve a REST API. 

## Data Models

> **All models are defined in src/model.js**

### Profile

A profile can be either a `client` or a `contractor`.
clients create contracts with contractors. contractor does jobs for clients and get paid.
Each profile has a balance property.

### Contract

A contract between and client and a contractor.
Contracts have 3 statuses, `new`, `in_progress`, `terminated`. contracts are considered active only when in status `in_progress` Contracts group jobs within them.

### Job

contractor get paid for jobs by clients under a certain contract.

## Getting Set Up

Project based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Run `npm install` to get all dependencies.

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.


## Technical Notes

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

- The database provider is SQLite, which will store data in a file local to your repository called `database.sqlite3`. The ORM [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is on top of it. 

- To authenticate users use the `getProfile` middleware that is located under src/middleware/getProfile.js. users are authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. after a user is authenticated his profile will be available under `req.profile`.

## APIs To Implement

List of the API's endpoints for the application.

1. **_GET_** `/contracts/:id` - returns the contract only if it belongs to the profile calling.

2. **_GET_** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only contain non terminated contracts.

3. **_GET_** `/jobs/unpaid` - Get all unpaid jobs for a user (**_either_** a client or contractor), for **_active contracts only_**.

4. **_POST_** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

5. **_POST_** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

6. **_GET_** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.

7. **_GET_** `/admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer>` - returns the clients the paid the most for jobs in the query time period. limit query parameter should be applied, default limit is 2.
